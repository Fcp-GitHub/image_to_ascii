# Image to ASCII converter

## Explanation
`image_to_ascii` is a simple command-line C implementation of an image-to-ASCII converter. <br>
Given an instruction and the file name, it will recreate a terminal-compatible representation of the given image. <br>
The program uses ANSI escape sequences to print colored output, that is however limited only to the original 8 available colors. <br>
Although the black-and-white functionality seems good, the colored outputs may seem a bit poor due to the really restricted supplied color palette. <br>
For more informations use `image_to_ascii -h`.

## A simple example
As an example, here is an image (generated by a program inspired by the site [scipython.com](https://scipython.com/blog/recamans-sequence/)):
![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2a8f9ca-8b8d-4456-bf09-4d6d627d0a0b "Original image")
And the following is its ASCII form:

## System support
The program should work in every unix system that supports ANSI escape sequences (see for example [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code)).<br>

## Dependencies and compilation
In order to compile the given code, two nice single-header file libraries are needed:
- [`stb_image.h`](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h)
- [`stb_image_resize2.h`](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image_resize2.h)

After this, compilation is pretty straightforward. For example, using the GNU Compiler:
```
gcc image_to_ascii.c -lm -o image_to_ascii
```
